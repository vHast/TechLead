        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user interface of a website, through the use of <span class="bolder">HTML, CSS, and Javascript</span>, so that users can view and interact with that website.
        </p>
        <p>These are the three pillars that are essential in this technology stack, after that you'll have to learn how to use libraries such as React or Bootstrap in order to enhance the user experience in your website.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Path</h2>
        <p>You'll have to learn HTML5/CSS3 first, <span class="bolder">HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the web, CSS3 stands for cascading style sheets</span>, which is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
        </p>
        <p>To learn these two technologies first it works greatly to get the <span class="bolder">Responsive Web Design Certification</span>, it will also teach you the basics of web design but you shouldn't worry about it since you're not a UI/UX designer, but it's always great to learn something new.</p>
        <p>Make sure to finish the projects in the end, you should be able to create your own portfolio website or any tribute page of any personal interest you've got.</p>

        <a class='btn' href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design Certification</a>

        <p>At this time you should get a <span class="bolder">GitHub</span> and start getting around version control, I suggest using Git Bash if you're on Windows, get in and start uploading code, and more importantly, look into other people's code and<span class="bolder"> try to understand it</span>.</p>

        <a class='btn' href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

        <p>Now we should be able to get our hands dirty with actual programming, we'll have to learn Javascript for that, which is <span class="bolder">a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the web</span>, over 97% of the websites use Javascript on the client side for web page behavior</p>

        <p>It will be useful if one day you'll want to go to learn Backend development and get in touch with Node.js</p>

        <p>In order to start learning Javascript you should complete the following certification.</p>

        <a class='btn' href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/" target="_blank">Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures</a>

        <p>I must warn you that this course is not very intuitive, it misses some important aspects to Web Development such as the <span class="bolder">DOM (Document Object Model)</span> and more complex algorithm solving, so I'm going to list a few resources that will help you to achieve that knowledge. 
        </p>

        <a class='btn' href="https://javascript.info/" target="_blank">Javascript.info</a>

        <a class='btn' href="hhttps://eloquentjavascript.net/14_dom.html/" target="_blank">Eloquent Javascript: DOM</a>

        <a class='btn' href="https://www.codewars.com/dashboard/" target="_blank">CodeWars: Algorithm Problems</a>

        <p>This is where a huge bulk of time should be invested in, the next step will be learning a Javascript framework, but I must encourage you to <span class="bolder">learn the foundations of Javascript</span> since it will be very useful when getting ahead of any JS framework.</p>

        <p>And at this point I would encourage you to <span class="bolder">start collaborating in any HTML/CSS/JS project in GitHub</span>, and start working into your own profile page to include all the projects you've done so far.</p>

        <p>The next step should be learning React, which is included in the Front End Development Libraries certification in freeCodeCamp</p>

        <a class='btn' href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/" target="_blank">Front End Development Libraries Certification</a>

        <p>And this is where I am currently at! I'll upload more information regarding this path as soon as I progress.</p>
