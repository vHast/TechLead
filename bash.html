        <h1>Bash and the Command Line</h1>
        <img src="/img/blog1icon.png" alt="A Bash terminal icon">
      </div>
      <ul class="blogcontent">
        <li>It is very probable that you may have heard of the Bash Shell if you've taken interest in getting certified in the <span class="bolder">CompTIA Linux+ XKO-004 Certification</span>.</li>
        <li>For beginners that don't know what a shell is, it's basically a computer program that presents a command line interface which <span class="bolder">allows you to control your computer using commands</span> entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces(GUIs).</li>
        <li>Bash is simply the default interpreter on many GNU/Linux systems, before continuing we'd like you to invite to install any Linux distribution to get started using Bash, Mint works wonders for beginners.</li>
        <li>Even if you're not interested in server administration, it's useful for upstarting your productivity once you get the hang of it.</li>
        <li>To start your Bash terminal, locate the icon, or simply press Ctrl + Alt + T.</li>
        <li>Your first task will be to determine which is your default interpreter</li>
        <aside class="codeblock">
          <code>~$ echo $SHELL</code>
          <code>/bin/bash </code>
        </aside>
        <li>This is a good practice since we need to determine which our default interpreter is, as there are several other shell interpreters available, such as the C shell.</li>
        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <li>In order to navigate through our folders, we are going to need to learn a few commands.</li>
        <li>The important ones are <span class="bolder">pwd, ls, and cd.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bolder">pwd</span> will print your current location.</li>
        <aside class="codeblock">
          <code>~$ pwd</code>
          <code>/home/(yourUserName) </code>
        </aside>
        <li><span class="bolder">ls</span> will list the files in your current location, you can also add <span class="bolder">-a</span> after <span class="bolder">ls</span> in order to see the hidden files.</li>
        <aside class="codeblock">
          <code>~$ ls</code>
          <code>Documents Music Templates Desktop Downloads Pictures Public Videos</code>
        </aside>
        <li>In order to access any of these locations, all you have to do is type <span class="bolder">cd</span> and the folder you're interested in accessing.</li>
        <aside class="codeblock">
          <code>~$ cd Documents</code>
          <code> ~/Documents $</code>
        </aside>
        <li>Once inside the folder you are, you can always go back with <span class="bolder">cd ..</span></li>
        <aside class="codeblock">
          <code>~/Documents $ cd ..</code>
          <code>~$  </code>
        </aside>
        <li>This way of accessing your data is much faster than going around clicking icons and searching for the right folder to go.</li>
        <li>There are tools that we could install into our system that will enhance the experience, one of my favorites is Vim which is a very good text editor, imagine that we have a text file filled with code.</li>
        <li>Most of us would just launch Visual Studio Code and configure it, but if we know exactly what we want to do, we could just locate the file we want to edit through the command line and open it with Vim / Nano or Cat</li>
        <aside class="codeblock">
          <code>~$ ls</code>
          <code>Documents Music Templates Desktop</code>
          <code>~$ cd Documents</code>
          <code> ~/Documents $ ls</code>
          <code>index.html</code>
          <code> ~/Documents $ vim index.html</code>
        </aside>
        <li>First we check which documents are in our root with <span class="bolder">ls</span>, after that we decide to go to Documents using the <span class="bolder">cd</span> command.</li>
        <li>We check again the contents of the folder with <span class="bolder">ls</span> and we see that we've got in sight the file that we are interested in which is index.html</li>
        <li>We finally open the document using the program of our interested with the name of the file we are interested in working in after</li>
        <li>This method works for a lot of programs but some have different parameters, and you should check the documentation.</li>
        <li>For example, I'm a big Doom fan and in order to play custom WADs I need to put -file after the program</li>

        <aside class="codeblock">
          <code>~$ zdoom -file btsx_e1_std.wad</code>
        </aside>

        <li>It's a different nomenclature but the structure is similar for a lot of programs.</li>

        <li>And for now this is the essential information that I can offer to you now, if you want to further increase your knowledge on Bash and learn bash scripting I suggest you take a look at <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/bash-quick-start-guide/9781789538830" target="_blank">Bash - Quick Start Guide</a> from Packt</li>
