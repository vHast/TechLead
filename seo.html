      </div>
      <ul class="blogcontent">
        <li>Let's get one thing straight, <span class="bolder">exposure is one of the things that we greatly look upon</span>, since it gives us the <span class="bolder">opportunity to reach potential clients and gives us the chance to offer our products and services to them.</span></li>
        <li>We could combine the best marketing ideas, ways to convince the potential client using the right words, but there's one tiny mistake that we're commiting here.</li>
        <li>No amount of marketing or complex verbose will <span class="bolder">convince an Google's site crawler about what our website is offering or selling.</span></li>
        <li>We need to find the right tools, and for that we need to take a deep look at the <span class="bolder">meta tags that HTML5 offers</span> in order to generate more traffic.</li>

        <h2>The title tag</h2>

        <li>This is considered the most important tag that you should place in your HTML, <span class="bolder">any search engine needs to know what the content of your website is</span>, and the title tag describes the topic of each page or piece of content on your website.</li>
        <img src="/img/seo1.png" alt="An image showing a result in Google Search">
        <li>This is my own website, my name and my profession is enclosed in a title tag and it displays and tells the search engine and the potential customer, <span class="bolder">who I am and what I do.</span></li>

        <li>The rest of the text is lower <span class="bolder">h1 h2,h3</span> tags that still interact with the search engine but we'll explain that later.</li>

        <h2>The meta tag</h2>

        <li>The meta tags are a couple of <span class="bolder">keywords that will provide information that further describe what the content is about</span>.</li>
        
        <img src="/img/metatags.png" alt="An image showing the code in the meta tags of HTML5">

        <li>For example in the meta description, we should <span class="bolder">pair the words that are the focus of the content of our website in order to increase its efficiency</span>, pay attention to the "Web Developer" and "UI/UX" word pairing.</li>

        <h2>Header tags</h2>

        <li>We mostly use the header tags to organize the content of our website, but it also <span class="bolder">greatly improves our SEO</span>, when we specify this tag to the headers of the content we are displaying, we communicate to the search engine what it is about.</li>

        <li>Sometimes if we even do it properly it will stack and show it as a preview of our website in the search result.</li>

        <h2>img alt tags</h2>

        <li>Search engines can't read images, <span class="bolder">but it can understand the content of the alt tag in our img elements</span>.</li>

        <img src="/img/metatags3.png" alt="">

        <li>This will give the opportunity of the images to reach <span class="bolder">Google Images, this will result in increased traffic and visualization of our content</span></li>

        <li>These are just a few tricks that you could do to optimize the traffic of your website to increse the exposure of the contents that you're interested to share or market</li>

        <li>If youre interested in continuing to learn about this matter, <span class="bolder">Google has released a guide</span> in .pdf that it's very valuable to progress in this field, <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.dk/en/dk/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a> to start reading and increase the traffic in your website!</li>
