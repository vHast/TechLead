        <li>Let's get one thing straight, exposure is one of the things that we greatly look upon, since it gives us the opportunity to makes us visible to possible clients and gives us the chance to offer our products and services to them.</li>
        <li>We could combine the best marketing ideas, ways to convince the potential client using the right words, but there's one tiny mistake that we're commiting here.</li>
        <li>No amount of marketing or complex verbose will convince an Google's site crawler about what our website is offering or selling.</li>
        <li>We need to find the right tools, and for that we need to take a deep look at the META tags that HTML5 offers in order to generate more traffic.</li>

        <h2>The title tag</h2>

        <li>This is considered the most important tag that you should place in your HTML, any search engine needs to know what the content of your website is, and the title tag describes the topic of each page or piece of content on your website.</li>
        <img src="/img/seo1.png" alt="An image showing a result in Google Search">
        <li>This is my own website, my name and my profession is enclosed in a title tag and it displays is and communicates the search engine and the potential customer, who I am and what I do.</li>

        <li>The rest of the text is lower  h1 h2, h3 tags that still interact with the search engine but it's not as important but it still shows the content of the website without even clicking it.</li>

        <h2>The meta tag</h2>

        <li>The meta tags are a couple of keywords that will provide information that further describe what the content is about.</li>
        
        <img src="/img/seo2.png" alt="An image showing the code in the meta tags of HTML5">

        <li>For example in the meta description, we should pair the words that are the focus of the content of our website in order to increase its efficiency.</li>
      </ul>
