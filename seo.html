      <ul class="blogcontent">
        <li>Let's get one thing straight, exposure is one of the things that we greatly look upon, since it gives us the opportunity to makes us visible to possible clients and gives us the chance to offer our products and services to them.</li>
        <li>We could combine the best marketing ideas, ways to convince the potential client using the right words, but there's one tiny mistake that we're commiting here.</li>
        <li>No amount of marketing or complex verbose will convince an Google's site crawler about what our website is offering or selling.</li>
        <li>We need to find the right tools, and for that we need to take a deep look at the META tags that HTML5 offers in order to generate more traffic.</li>

        <h2>The title tag</h2>

        <li>This is considered the most important tag that you should place in your HTML, any search engine needs to know what the content of your website is, and the title tag describes the topic of each page or piece of content on your website.</li>
        <img src="/img/seo1.png" alt="An image showing a result in Google Search">
        <li>This is my own website, my name and my profession is enclosed in a title tag and it displays is and communicates the search engine and the potential customer, who I am and what I do.</li>

        <li>The rest of the text is lower  h1 h2, h3 tags that still interact with the search engine but it's not as important but it still shows the content of the website without even clicking it.</li>

        <h2>The meta tag</h2>

        <li>The meta tags are a couple of keywords that will provide information that further describe what the content is about.</li>
        
        <img src="/img/metatags.png" alt="An image showing the code in the meta tags of HTML5">

        <li>For example in the meta description, we should pair the words that are the focus of the content of our website in order to increase its efficiency, pay attention to the "Web Developer" and "UI/UX" word pairing.</li>

        <h2>Header tags</h2>

        <li>We mostly use the header tags to organize the content of our website, but it also greatly improves our SEO, when we specify this tag to the headers of the content we are displaying, we communicate to the search engine what it is about.</li>

        <li>Sometimes if we even do it properly it will stack and show it as a preview of our website in the search result.</li>

        <h2>img alt tags</h2>

        <li>Search engines can't read images, but it can understand the content of the alt tag in our img elements</li>

        <img src="/img/metatags3.png" alt="">

        <li>This will give the opportunity of the images to reach Google Images, this will result in increased traffic and visualization of our content</li>

        <li>These are just a few tricks that you could do to optimize the traffic of your website to increse the exposure of the contents that you're interested to share or market</li>

        <li>If youre interested in continuing to learn about this matter, Google has released a guide in .pdf that it's very valuable to progress in this field, <a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.dk/en/dk/webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf">click here</a> to start reading and increase the traffic in your website!</li>
