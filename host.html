        <li>Once you've already completed a couple of projects, you might want to feel the eagerness to <span class="bolder">share what you've done to your friends, partners or even future employers.</span></li>
        <li>You can always share the code you've invested hours to get that applet working and deploy it to GitHub, it might work wonders but the reality is that <span class="bolder">you're making your potential employer waste time in locating the code, downloading it, extracting it and hosting it in their own local machine.</span></li>
        <li>Sometimes people that will review your portfolio <span class="bolder">may not even be tech savvy</span> and you know how hard it is to even get the grasp of version controlling in the beginning.</li>
        <li><span class="bolder">So there's basically no excuse in not uploading your projects to a host</span>, this way you'll make your potential employer <span class="bolder">skip a lot of steps and straightly deliver content to him.</span></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> offers free hosting for your projects, all you need to do is to <span class="bolder">associate your GitHub profile to the platform</span>, and it will mirror the contents of the repository of your interest to a website.</li>
        <li>The website you're using right now makes use of that service.</li>
        <li>Create an account in Netlify (you can also use your GitHub account as a login token for easiness of use) and you'll reach the dashboard, this will contain all your deployed sites.</li>
        <li>In order to add your site, you need to press the <span class="bolder">Add New Site</span> button and select the Import an existing project option.</li>
        <img src="/img/tutorial.png" alt="An image showing a button to upload your code to the Netlify Platform">

        <li>Once you've done this, the webiste will ask you to connect to a Git provider, it will ask you to login to your GitHub account again, <span class="bolder">select the GitHub option</span> and complete the process.</li>

        <img src="/img/tutorial2.png" alt="An image showing the varius ways of uploading code to Netlify">

        <li>After this step the website will ask which repository would you like to upload to the host, just <span class="bolder">choose the repository you're interested in</span>.</li>

        <img src="/img/tutorial3.png" alt="An image showing how Netlify asks which repository we would like to mirror">

        <li>After we've chosen our repository, all we have to do is continue and click <span class="bolder">Deploy site</span> in the next website.</li>

        <li>Our website will take between two or three minutes in order to be uploaded, once it does, it will be available in this window</li>

        <img src="/img/tutorial5.png" alt="An image showing the information panel about our website">

        <li>And there it is! The link to our website is right there, it consists of a random series of words and numbers but we can of course change it if we decide <span class="bolder">to buy a domain for our own website</span>, if you're interested in getting a domain for your own website, I suggest <a href="https://www.epik.com/" target="_blank">Epik</a> for the low prices and availability.</li>
