        <li>Once you've already completed a couple of projects, you might want to feel the eagerness to share what you've done to your friends, partners or even future employers.</li>
        <li>You can always share the code you've invested hours to get that applet working and deploy it to GitHub, it might work wonders but the reality is that you're making your potential employer waste time in locating the code, downloading it, extracting it and hosting it in their own local machine.</li>
        <li>Sometimes people that will review your portfolio may not even be tech savvy and you know how hard it is to even get the grasp of version controlling in the beginning.</li>
        <li>So there's basically no excuse in not uploading your projects to a host, this way you'll make your potential employer skip a lot of steps and straightly deliver content to him.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank">Netlify</a> offers free hosting for your projects, all you need to do is to associate your GitHub profile to the platform, and it will mirror the contents of the repository of your interest to a website.</li>
        <li>The website you're using right now makes use of that service.</li>
        <li>Create an account in Netlify (you can also use your GitHub account as a login token for easiness of use) and you'll reach the dashboard, this will contain all your deployed sites.</li>
        <li>In order to add your site, you need to press the Add New Site button and select the Import an existing project option.</li>
        <img src="/img/tutorial.png" alt="An image showing a button to upload your code to the Netlify Platform">

        <li>Once you've done this, the webiste will ask you to connect to a Git provider, it will ask you to login to your GitHub account again, select the GitHub option and complete the process.</li>

        <img src="/img/tutorial2.png" alt="An image showing the varius ways of uploading code to Netlify">

        <li>After this step the website will ask which repository would you like to upload to the host, just choose the repository you're interested in.</li>

        <img src="/img/tutorial3.png" alt="An image showing how Netlify asks which repository we would like to mirror">

        <li>After we've chosen our repository, all we have to do is continue and click Deploy site in the next website.</li>

        <li>Our website will take between two or three minutes in order to be uploaded, once it does, it will be available in this window</li>

        <img src="/img/tutorial5.png" alt="An image showing the information panel about our website">

        <li>And there it is! The link to our website is right there, it consists of a random series of words and numbers but we can of course change it if we decide to buy a domain for our own website, if you're interested in getting a domain for your own website, I suggest <a href="https://www.epik.com/" target="_blank">Epik</a> for the low prices and availability.</li>
