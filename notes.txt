It is very probable that you may have heard of the Bash Shell if you've taken interest in getting certified in the CompTIA Linux+ XKO-004 Certification.

For beginners that don't know what a shell is, it's basically a computer program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces(GUIs).

Bash is simply the default interpreter on many GNU/Linux systems, before continuing we'd like you to invite to install any Linux distribution to get started using Bash, Mint works wonders for beginners.

Even if you're not interested in server administration, it works wonders for upstarting your productivity once you get the hang of it.

To start your Bash terminal, locate the icon, or simply press Ctrl + Alt + T

Your first task will be to determine which is your default interpreter

$ echo $SHELL 
/bin/bash 

This is a good practice since we need to determine which our default interpreter is, as there are several other shell interpreters available, such as the C shell.

In order to navigate through our folders, we are going to need to learn a few commands.

The important ones are pwd, ls, and cd.

pwd will print your current location.

ls will list the files in your current location, you can also add -a after ls in order to see the hidden files.

In order to access any of these locations, all you have to do is type cd and the folder you're interested in accessing.

Once inside the folder you are, you can always go back with cd ..
