        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>A system administrator, or sysadmin, or admin is a person who is responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of computer systems, especially multi-user computers, such as servers.
        </p>
        <p>I never took any particular interest about this position, but since I started using Linux and my enthusiasm for the Free Software ethics started to kick in, I checked if there were any Linux certificates that I could get my hands on.</p>
      
        <p>There were a few, CompTIA+, the organization that sets them up, have many certificate for every flavor of system administrator that you'd like to become.</p>
        <p>The exams are not that expensive, depending on your country it may cost more or less, in Estonia, where I am located right now, costs around 120$, which is extremely cheap for what it offers.</p>
        <p>There are several job offers where they're not asking for the formal college grade, but the certificate that CompTIA+ grants.</p>
        
        <p>Before going any further, investigate what kind of system administrator you're interested to become and once you do that, come back.</p>

        <p>And it will be useful to check your local job market for the certificates people are asking for.</p>

        <h2>The Path</h2>
        <p>Once you've chosen which certificate you're interested in, several websites will offer a plan to train you to pass the exam (these exams need to be passed every 3 years or so, depending on the certificate).
        </p>
        <p>My suggestion is to find a buddy that could lend you a .pdf with the contents of the course to see if you're really interested in and stick with it for a month or two to see if it really clicks on you.</p>
        <p>Once you've made your decision, depending on your level of expertise you could choose between paying for an interactive course with "labs" (which is just a fancy word for an environment setup for whichever activity you're supposed to do, similar to freeCodeCamp exercises), which is alright if you're new into the tech industry.</p>

        <p>Or you could go self-taught, studying from the book and creating the environment yourself (for example, I am interested in Linux+, I should install Rocky Linux to get hands on server experience and practice there) and checking for resources.</p>

        <p>CompTIA+ books offer guidelines on how to study and how to setup everything properly, and I personalyl think that if you learn to do that in your own it's way more valuable.</p>

        <p>It's going to take a while to study and reach the exam, all I can say is that you should invest time in it and in the end the effort will be worth it, as I write this I can't wait to get to keep studying on my Linux+ certificate that I'm working towards!</p>
